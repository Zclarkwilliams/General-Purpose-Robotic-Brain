/****************************************\
*
*	CMake Global Variable
*
\****************************************/

CMAKE_BINARY_DIR	-> When building in-source, this is equivalent to
		    	   CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR, otherwise this is the top level 
			   directory of your build tree.

CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR	-> This is the directory from which CMake was stared, i.e. 
			   the top level source directory.

CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR-> This will hold the path to currently processed node 

EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH	-> Set this Variable to specify a common place where CMake 
			   should put all executable files.
			   (instead of CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
			   
			   example: 
			   > SET(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin)

LIBARARY_OUTPUT_PATH	-> Set this variable to specify a common place where CMake 
			   should put all libraries.
			   (instead of CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR).
			   
			   example: 
			   > SET(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/lib)

PROJECT_NAME		-> The name of the project set by PROJECT() command.

PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR	-> Contains the full path to the root of your project souce 
			   directory, i.e. to nearest dir where CMakeLists.txt 
			   contains the PROJECT() command. Now,  you have to 
			   compile the main.cpp. The way to do this task is too 
			   simple.

			   example: 
			   > add_executable(hello ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/test.cpp)

/****************************************\

*   Build the source code with CMake

\****************************************/

# First - Create CMake configuration files inside folder 'build'
	
	$ sudo cmake -H. -Bbuild

# Second - Generate the output program, or binary executable, for the project 	
	   specified by PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR and store it in the folder spcified by 
	   CMAKE_BINARY_DIR folder.

	$ sudo cmake --build build -- -j3
